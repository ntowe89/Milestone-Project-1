# Milestone-Project-1 Update

Yahtzee? What was my inspiration for making this game? When we first started talking about this project, I automatically wanted to do a board game I used to play growing up. I thought of several games I wanted to build, but I had to make sure I chose one that I knew I could complete within the given timeframe. Therefore, I narrowed it down to Yahtzee. 

Yahtzee is a great game with five dice. You get up to three rolls per turn and you don't have to use all three rolls. On each roll, you can choose to keep any number of dice to help get one of the thirteen categories or roll all the dice again. After each turn you must place a score or a zero in one of the categories. 

Here are all the categories (must fill in one box per turn) 
- Aces (ones), add up all the ones you haved rolled.
- Twos, add up all the twos you have rolled. 
- Threes, add up all the threes you have rolled.
- Fours, add up all the fours you have rolled.
- Fives, add up all the fives you have rolled.
- Sixes, add up all the sixes you have rolled.
- Three of a kind, must have at least 3 of the same dice to use this box. If you have a three of a kind, then you can add all five dice.
- Four of a kind, must have at least 4 of the same dice to use this box. If you have a four of a kind, then you can add all five dice.
- Full House, must have two of the same dice and three of the same dice for this box. For example, two 4's and three 6's. If you get a full house, you get 25 points.
- Small Straight, must have four dice in a row (1,2,3,4 or 2,3,4,5 or 3,4,5,6). If you land a small straight, you get 30 points.
- Large Straight, must have all five dice in a row (1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6).
- Yahtzee, must have five of the same kind. Yahtzee is worth 50 points. 
- Chance, add up all five dice. 


To create this game I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Most of it being JavaScript.
